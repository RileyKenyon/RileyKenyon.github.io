# Mechatronics Police Academy
The Mechatronics project was centered on getting hands-on with electronics to build an autonomous robot. The brain of the robot was a Raspberry Pi with support from a microcontroller for sensor processing and motor allocation. The targeting system utilized a Luxonis camera to recursively center the firing mechanism when a target was identified. The navigation relied on a keras model that ran using tensorflow lite on the Raspberry Pi to determine a heading based on the robot's current location. The final report of the project can be found here.
