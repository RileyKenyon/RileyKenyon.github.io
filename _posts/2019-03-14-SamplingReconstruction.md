tags: [Control Theory, Matlab]
style: fill
color: light
description: This report describes the Shannon Sampling Theorem and how its properties can be applied to the Nyquist frequency using a sample signal. Signal aliasing can be attributed to sampling and reconstruction, which will be proven with an example signal in combination with different filters for convolution.
