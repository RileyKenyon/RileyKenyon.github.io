# **About Me**

I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student at the **University of Colorado, Boulder** (May 2020) pursuing my interests in mechatronics, automation, and control theory. I am an avid 3D printer, robotics hobbyist, and musician. I have experience in R&D for the wind industry where I worked to develop a prototype that is being commercialized by **Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy**. My other industry experience includes creating an automated quality control system for a manufacturing facility based off a microcontroller to increase their testing efficiency by 30%. 

I regularly use the linux command line and I have developed a personal interest in software/hardware integration. I am most comfortable with Matlab and Simulink, but have taught myself C, CUDA, and python. In my time as a student I have collected a significant amount of embedded hardware which I use in my projects - my favorite currently being the Jetson Nano from NVIDIA. 

Currently, I hold several certifications related to CAD and software.
* CSWA (certified SolidWorks associate)
* NVIDIA Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++
* STK Level 1 Certified 

In the future, I aspire to be a controls and robotics engineer. Currently I am working towards that goal by broadening my knowledge base on the subject, picking up projects, and reading literature in the field.
