# **About Me**

I am a recent graduate from the **University of Colorado, Boulder** with a master's degree in mechanical engineering. During my time in academia, I have pursued my interests in mechatronics, automation, and control theory. I am an avid 3D printer, robotics hobbyist, and musician (I play the baritone). I have experience in R&D for the wind industry where I worked to develop a prototype that is being commercialized by **Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy**. My other industry experience includes creating an automated quality control system for a manufacturing facility based off a microcontroller to increase their testing efficiency by 30%. 

I regularly use the linux command line and I have developed a personal interest in software/hardware integration. Although I am most comfortable with Matlab and Simulink, I have taught myself C, CUDA, and python. In my time as a student I have collected a significant amount of embedded hardware which I use in my projects - my favorite being the Jetson Nano from NVIDIA. 

Currently, I hold several certifications related to CAD and software.
* [CSWA (certified SolidWorks associate)](https://3dexperience.virtualtester.com/#certvalidate) (C-33LVZSD55F)
* [NVIDIA Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++](https://courses.nvidia.com/certificates/4b41430edbef4d3591da488224119385)
* [STK Level 1 Certified](/img/2019/RK_Level1.png)
* [Embedded Hardware and Software Architecture](/img/2019/EmbeddedCert.pdf) 

In the future, I aspire to be a controls and robotics engineer. I am working towards that goal by broadening my knowledge on the subject, picking up projects, and reading literature in the field.
