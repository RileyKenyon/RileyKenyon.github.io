# **About Me**

## Academia
I graduated from the **University of Colorado, Boulder** in May, 2020 with a master's degree in mechanical engineering. During my time in university, I pursued my interests in mechatronics, automation, and control theory - tailoring my graduate curriculum to project based coursework for hands on experience. I served as a teaching assistant for the undergrad system dynamics course, pursued an [independent study](/projects/2-independent-study) under Dr. Shalom Ruben using NVIDIA GPUs, and created a [robot to launch nerf projectiles](/projects/6-mechatronics) at targets while traversing a maze. I have samples of my technical mettle and schenanigans under my [blog](/blog/) and [projects](/projects/) page.


## Career
Currently I am a Controls Engineer at **Trimble** in their <a href="https://autonomy.trimble.com/en/" target="_blank">Autonomy division</a> working with off-road autonomous vehicles for agriculture :tractor: and construction :construction:. Day to day I use a variety of programming languages (C, Python, Simulink) and operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux), and am familiar with communication protocols such as CAN (primarily <a href="https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/j1939-explained-simple-intro-tutorial" target="_blank">J1939</a>) and UDP. Most of my work is centered around model based design using Matlab and Simulink for functional safety (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69025.html" target="_blank">ISO 25119</a>, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/70715.html" target="_blank">ISO 19014</a>), including generating code from models and wrapping existing C source code for use in simulation. 

Prior to off-road autonomy, I have experience in service R&D for the wind industry where I developed a [wind turbine blade inspection](/projects/1-sgre-project) prototype that was being commercialized by **Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy**. My other industry experience includes creating an [automated quality control system](/projects/7-automated-quality-control) for a manufacturing facility based off a microcontroller to increase their testing efficiency by 30%. 

I regularly use the linux command line and I have developed a personal interest in software/hardware integration. Although I am most comfortable with Matlab and Simulink, I have taught myself C/C++ and python. In my time as a student I have collected a significant amount of embedded hardware which I use in my persoanl projects - my favorite being the Jetson Nano from NVIDIA :computer:. I am an avid 3D printer, robotics hobbyist, and musician. Check out my [github](https://github.com/RileyKenyon) :octocat: to see what I have been up to recently!

## Certifications
Currently, I hold several professional and academic certificates. Most recently I am pursuing courses in Self-Driving vehicles published by the University of Toronto on Coursera.
* [Introduction to Self-Driving Cars](https://coursera.org/share/032ec70ab4c0c89af6ac137e3cae8d09)
* [State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars](https://coursera.org/share/99d5d409f171ad2d520ee38bdeeea653)

Software related certifications:
* [NVIDIA Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++](https://courses.nvidia.com/certificates/4b41430edbef4d3591da488224119385)
* [Embedded Hardware and Software Architecture](/img/2019/EmbeddedCert.pdf) 

Mechanical engineering certifications:
* [FE Mechanical Exam](https://account.ncees.org/rn/1995547-1203096-0c607b3)
* [CSWA (certified SolidWorks associate)](https://3dexperience.virtualtester.com/#certvalidate) (C-33LVZSD55F)
* [STK Level 1 Certified](/img/2019/RK_Level1.png)

I aspire to better my understanding of autonomy everyday by exercising my existing skillset, picking up projects, and reviewing literature to broaden my domain knowledge.
