# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student at the University of Colorado, Boulder pursuing my interests in mechatronics, automation, and control theory. Outside of academia and my career I enjoy bowling, tinkering with electronics, and home improvement. Throughout my undergrad I was involved the Golden Buffalo Marching Band as the baritone section leader. My most memorable experiences in college were traveling with the band to support the football and basketball teams.
